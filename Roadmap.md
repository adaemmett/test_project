## Project Mission and Summary

#### Mission 
##### Determine differences in diel nitrogen cycling patterns in “unpolluted” and “polluted” streams, and see if we can develop a threshold at what nitrate concentration a stream becomes “polluted” (diel N signature masked). Questions: Is the threshold the same in all climates? In all stream orders? In all times of year?  

#### Milestones
1.	Establish gross primary productivity (GPP) calculations for each site to be used in metabolism evaluation  
		1. Select sites  
		2. Pull nitrate sensor data and site metadata from USGS  
		3. Organize data  
		4. Calculate GPP  
		5. Possibly release R script for GPP calculations to public  
2. See if we can numerically quantify the diel signal (to compare when the signal is evident vs not evident among different sites)  
3. Statistically evaluate sites to see if there is a difference in the minimum nitrate concentration at which the diel signal is masked
